## Dissertation Title:
**Deep Learning**


The work presented in this dissertation makes significant contributions to the fields of deep learning and battery health prognostics.
The datasets used in this study is from the NASA Ames Research Center [1].
Dataset is available at: https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/#battery

It extracts the needed features from the battery datasets, and compares CNN, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM models' performance using data from the charging, discharging, and combined charging and discharging cycle profiles.
